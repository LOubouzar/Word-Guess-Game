<!-- Homework Retrospective: 
  1. I wanted to source the script in the header but the javascript would load before the dom and wouldn't populate correctly. I attempted to fix this in the js file but I would just break it.
  2. I wanted to insert icons (assests/images/triforce.png) instead of using underscore to track the letter count.
  3. I also wanted to have an audio file continously play while the user played. But the play again button refreshed the page and therefore the audio file so I took it out.
I read that you can accomplish this with ajax calls but I'll wait until later in the program to try it again. 
  4. I wanted the background image to sync correctly with mobile and provided a mobile background to use however I couldn't get that to work. see the style.css
